## Identity-First AI for Humans, Communities, and Agents

heyOcto is an evolving AI assistant designed to support people, learning communities, and autonomous systems through identity, trust, and intelligent assistance.

Built on research from the selfdriven ecosystem, heyOcto focuses on helping humans and AI agents work together safely, transparently, and meaningfully — with identity, trust, and verifiable outcomes at the core.

At its heart, heyOcto exists to help individuals and communities:
- Understand themselves and their capabilities  
- Build trusted digital and agent identities  
- Turn knowledge into real-world action  
- Learn, collaborate, and grow with AI partners  

Octo (aka heyOcto) is curious, caring, and human-aligned, supporting learning and project-based work while operating within social and trust frameworks.
